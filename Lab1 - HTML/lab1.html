                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>The violin </b>  is a string instrument which has four strings and is played with a bow and was first built in the early 16th century, in Italy.
                        The earliest evidence for their existence is in paintings by Gaudenzio Ferrari from the 1530s, though Ferrari's instruments had only three strings.
                        The Academie musicale, a treatise written in 1556 by Philibert Jambe de Fer, gives a clear description of the violin family much as we know it today.

                    <p>
                        The violin strings are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E. It is held between the left collar bone (near the shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are
                        made by fingering (pressing on the strings) with the left hand while bowing with the right. Unlike guitar, it has no frets or other markers on the fingerboard.

                    <h3>Playing and technique</h3>
                    <p>
                        As with any other musical instrument, the violin may be played from written music, by ear, 
                        or through improvisation. It takes years of practice to become a good violinist. A beginner will start 
                        with pieces and or exercises that do not require precise or complicated technique in right or left hand. 
                        During "simple" songs, the violinist will develop fundamental skills necessary for all other techniques, 
                        such as proper bow and violin holding. The violinist has to learn to put the fingers in exactly the right 
                        place so that the music is “in tune”. This is called intonation. The musician will also learn vibrato. 
                        This changes the intonation of each note slightly by making it a little bit sharper (higher), then a little 
                        bit flatter (lower), producing a kind of wobble.

                        The song with a haunting four-note melody was originally a Ukranian folk song written as a “winter well-wishing song,”
                        said Anthony Potoczniak, a Rice University anthropology graduate student who is studying the song’s history.
                        Written in 1916 by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovich and titled “Shchedryk,” the song tells the tale of a swallow flying
                        into a household to proclaim the plentiful year that the family will have.
