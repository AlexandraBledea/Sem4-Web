                        The violin is a string instrument which has four strings and is played with a bow and was first built in the early 16th century, in Italy.
                        The earliest evidence for their existence is in paintings by Gaudenzio Ferrari from the 1530s, though Ferrari's instruments had only three strings.
                        The Academie musicale, a treatise written in 1556 by Philibert Jambe de Fer, gives a clear description of the violin family much as we know it today.
