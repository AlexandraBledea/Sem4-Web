Solve the following task using only the jQuery library (production version, jquery.min.js, or developement version, jquery.js);
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ANY OTHER JS LIBRARY, PLUGIN OR EXTENSION BESIDES THE JQUERY LIBRARY. Write a web page which displays in the
middle of the browser window a horizontal slider containing a list of images. The slider should continuously slide from the left to the
right side of the browser window. Each image that exits the browser window on the right side should enter the browser window on the left
side. The sliding should be animated. If the user clicks on an image, the sliding is paused and a larger version of that window pops in
the center of the browser window (just like images appear in the Lightbox javascript library). If the user clicks anywhere on this large
image, the image dissapears and the sliding of the horizontal image bar is resumed.
